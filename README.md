# Contribution-Graph

A simple Python script that prints out a GitHub-style contribution graph in your terminal.

## What?

A script that generates GitHub-like contribution graphs for your local commits in the CLI.

## Why?

If you're like me, that contribution graph gives you a little serotonin boost.  
But if you're working in a CLI environment without access to the web console, that boost shouldn't have to suffer.

## How?

A bit of Python scripting and some workplace ADHD.

## Usage

Place the script in a master folder. It will recursively search all subdirectories, collect Git commit data, and display the contribution graph in your terminal.

```bash
python3 Contribution-graph.py
```
