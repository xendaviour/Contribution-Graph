# Contribution-Graph

A **completely unnecessary but emotionally essential** Python script that prints a GitHub-style contribution graph in your terminal.

## What?

It's a script.  
It draws a little green box calendar.  
It makes you feel good about your life choices.  
That's it.

## Why?

Because we live for the green squares.  
Because productivity is a feeling, not a metric.  
Because sometimes, you just need a pat on the back from your terminal.

## How?

- Take one mildly bored developer.
- Add Python.
- Mix in some Git logs and ANSI colors.
- Bake at 350Â°F for 20 minutes (or just run the script).

## Usage

Drop the script into a directory filled with Git repos (or just your life's work).  
Then run:

```bash
python3 Contribution-graph.py
```
## It will:
- Traverse all subfolders.
- Gather Git commit data.
- Render a beautiful wall of green boxes.
- Remind you you're doing great (probably).

## Bonus
- No network calls. No tracking. No cookies.
- Just pure, locally sourced, artisanal ANSI output.
